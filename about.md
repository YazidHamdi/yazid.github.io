Yazid Hamdi, a young Tunisian software developer living in Berlin, an internet junkie and apparently a very talkative dude.

I often fail to self-describe, as is the case in this description, since my wastes of time are so numerous and diverse.

I speak Arabic, French and English perfectly and German with less fluency. I love quiet places, good stand-up comedy, sci-fi movies, software done right, great teammates, good video games and great cars. I aspire to to make cool useful software and hardware systems, to get a classic car and work on it and later in life to retire in a solar-powered olive and sheep farm somewhere warm in the heartland of Tunisia, with fiber (or maybe satellite?) internet connection and a [Land Cruiser](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Land+Cruiser) parked in front of the house.
