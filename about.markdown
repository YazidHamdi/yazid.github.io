Yazid Hamdi, a young Tunisian software developer, internet junkie and chatty dude. Often fails to self-describe, as is the case in this description, since his wastes of time are so numerous and diverse. Speaks Arabic, French and English perfectly and a little bit of German. Loves traveling, good stand-up comedy, sci-fi movies, clean beautiful code and great cars. Aspires to code awesome stuff in great style, to make cool games, to travel to space and later in life to retire in a solar-powered olive and sheep farm somewhere warm in Tunisia, with fiber (or maybe satellite?) internet connection (obviously), with a [Land Cruiser](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Land+Cruiser) parked in front of the house.
