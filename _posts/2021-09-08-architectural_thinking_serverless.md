I created [this presentation](https://www.slideshare.net/YazidHAMDI1/the-architectural-thinking-behind-full-stack-serverless-250145652) to provide a short introduction and overview of the interest of full stack serverless architectures over classic self-managed self-hosted ones. It discusses the tradeoffs and some fallacies.
