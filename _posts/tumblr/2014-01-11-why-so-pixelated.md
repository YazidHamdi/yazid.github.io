Needless to say, I’m from that generation that grew up in front of a bloated CRT TV screen, playing NES games, watching the beginning of globalization, enchanted with icons and colors, even believing that the paintbrush shaped button (copy) in MS Word’s screen would open a paint program (that would be richer than MS paint, of course).

But that’s not even close to the meaning of the name. My head sees the world as pixel art (I know it sounds like a statement by a wannabe geek teenage girl), bright colors, funny 8-bit glitch sounds, kinda like in Scott Pilgrim Vs The World, but with more cynicism, trolling and code. Yes I do code, sometimes. That applies to politics, to food, to code, to jokes, to funny cat memes and Joseph Ducreux macros… I guess that this weird description is just me trying (and failing) to describe that sweet sequel I keep from when my world was reduced to a few bright colorful pixels on a screen.

I find myself starting this blog in 2014 in [Tunisia](https://www.google.com/#q=tunisia), age 25, after what I hope will be my last written exam ever, and before what I hope would be the beginning of a life full of fulfillment, creativity and discoveries. I have so much to say and share, **it doesn’t matter if it doesn’t get read, I’m doing it for me**.

So to you, random bored stranger, welcome. This is one of the most random places you’ll find, because that’s how random my culture/thoughts/identity/interest list is.&nbsp;Oh and btw, I am Yazid Hamdi :)
