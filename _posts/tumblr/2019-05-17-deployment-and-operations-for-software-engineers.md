Happy to receive my copy of [Len Bass](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAG47YUBGG1bj2Ni3h_AdVD9xYju0hq69-Q/)’s new book, “Deployment and Operations for Software Engineers” .

I am also very happy about the mention that came with it!

This book is an effort to bring a better understanding for deployment and operations for software engineers, especially students who are typically taught how to design and code an app, but not how to deploy it or worry about operation and security.

I highly recommend it for students and junior software engineers who would like to evolve towards a full-stack dev role, an architect role or a devops role.
