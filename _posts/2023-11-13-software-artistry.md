A recurrent question in my role CTO is: how much process does your engineering team actually need?

As someone who formally studied Software Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University's Master of Software Engineering with the explicit goal of developing engineering leadership capabilities and systematic problem solving, I ended up identifiying two biases one should be wary of:

1) The strong belief that "good software engineering is an art", i.e. something shapeless, formless, uncontrollable, magical almost, not achievable through any kind of empirical study or research. This is, to be blunt, often either a beginner's attitude or that of someone who never really had to work on highly constrained, highly complex projects (scale, number of stakeholders, number of developers, etc.). It almost becomes a desire to belittle and systematically ignore any effort to quantify, study or formalize software engineering practices, preferring this fake "flexibility" which is really a desire not to do the work or learn from others' experiences. The packaging of this attitude varies, but I have learned to spot it. Anytime a developer (especially a junior) claims they are "a code craftsman", a red flag goes up. Anytime I read "method/technology X is dead", my skepticism activates. Anytime I see someone with uniform (if not an actual single one) experience tell me their theories about software development in general, and bash everything everyone else is doing, I know I'm dealing with an "artist", not an engineer.

2) The strong belief that "without formalized, explicit, heavy, tracked process we're done". People

How does this fit with the picture of a startup?

Startups are known for the "quick and dirty" aka. "move fast and break things" style of work, "fail early fail fast", which were funny enough adages pulled out of the context where they make sense (Software QA) and generalized into pitch decks for VCs.
