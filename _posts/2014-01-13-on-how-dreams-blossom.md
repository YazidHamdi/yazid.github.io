Today is a happy day.

Back when I was studying in Toulouse, and more precisely in 2010, several students having studied at&nbsp;[IPEST](http://www.ipest.rnu.tn) (my graduate scientific prep school in Tunisia) and I decided to found a local Toulouse branch of the[ADAI](http://www.ipestien.org/) (IPEST Alumni Association) since there were many of us in Toulouse at the time. This was of course motivated (and in a way suggested) by the ADAI officials in Paris, home of the association and kind of its geographical playground.

And like any Alumni association, the task was to gather the community around the project and create this unique blend of enjoyment (with fun activities, gatherings etc…) and commitment to the “cause”, by sharing responsibilities and tasks, and eventually creating a solid core team able to manage the branch and organize activities. So we worked hard, started making some noise and even got a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/ADAI.Toulouse), and soon, ADAI Toulouse EXISTED!

There were many difficulties along the way, some organizational and some motivational. We had gatherings, dinners, and the first ever Aid Barbecue for IPEST Alumni (apart from the ones that were organized by the local branch of the ATUGE)…

I did my best to enjoy it, up until the time I decided that I should step down as a leader of the branch and move on to pursue other interests.

But my friends carried on. I lost track of their news, and now, after 4 years, the moment came for me to rediscover ADAI Toulouse: it became a fully-functional, well-managed association, gathering Tunisian students in Toulouse in a cheerful and fun-filled atmosphere…

That made me think how the dreams and efforts of some anonymous people (the founders, most of whom are unknown to the new members) evolved to create this beautiful result. And I was really amazed by the continuity, by the fact that other people who came later believed in the same dream and worked hard to contribute in making it come true. It made me think also about the power of individuals, how they can surpass their weakness and meaninglessness in a higher order of history and through small yet persistent contributions, build what would go down in collective history as a major achievement. I can’t help but imagine that 100 years from now, if IPEST still exists, there will be an alumni association to welcome its students in Toulouse, and integrate them to form a group bound by this unique friendship that stays after one leaves a college… And you know what? My comrades and I started that in 2010, and it survived through what we (and everyone who contributed afterwards) managed to share and establish…

That’s the thing about dreams: when fed with sincere efforts and belief, they blossom. One tends to forget that in his moments of weakness, but it’s an ever shining truth. I’m proud of what we achieved, and proud of those who contributed to the achievement of that dream after we moved on.

This is a happy day indeed.
