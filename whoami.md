Yazid Hamdi, a Tunisian software engineer living in Berlin, an internet junkie and apparently a very talkative dude with moderately interesting things to say.

I often fail to self-describe, as is the case in this description, since my wastes of time are so numerous and diverse: gaming, motorcycles, books, sports, just walking in empty quiet places, writing with a very VERY inconsistent frequency, diy and building model toys, coding and web development, etc.

I speak Arabic, French and English pretty well and am getting there with German. I like to think I make cool useful software and hardware systems, and aspire to get a classic car/motorcycle and work on it and later in life to retire in a solar-powered olive and sheep farm somewhere warm in the heartland of Tunisia, with fiber (or maybe satellite?) internet connection and a [Land Cruiser](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Land+Cruiser) parked in front of the house.
